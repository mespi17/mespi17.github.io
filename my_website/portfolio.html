    <h1>This is My Portfolio Page</h1>
    <p>You are in my <mark>Portofolio page</mark>. In this page you can see some projects created from the months we've
    been in school.Take a look around and if you click on pictures, you will be taken to a different link
    where you will see some scratch projects.</p>

    <h2><u>What is Scratch?</u></h2>
        <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about">Scratch</a> is a <mark>free visual programming language</mark> developed by the MIT Media Lab. Scratch is used by students,
    scholars, teachers, and parents to easily create animations, games, and etcetera. It provides a stepping stone
    to the more advanced world of computer programming.</p>

        <h2><u>Arduino, What Is It?</u></h2>
	      <p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> is an <mark>open-source project that created microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices</mark> and interactive
	  objects that can sense and control physical devices.The project is based on microcontroller board designs, which use inputs and outputs in the same way an ordinary
	  computer does. Inputs capture information from the user or the environment while outputs do something with the information that has been captured. An input could be
	  digital or analog, and could come form the environment or a user. <mark>If you click on the first picture at the bottom it will take you to a link where many people have made
	  various projects with the arduino devices. Below is my Arduino blink project completed with my partner Daisy valdivia</mark>.</p>

        <h2><u>Weather balloon, What Is That?</u></h2>
            <p> Basically what this weather balloon does,  is a balloon
   which<mark> carries instruments aloft to send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed by means of a small, expendable measuring device</mark>
    in our an arduino. All this was done with the help of college students guiding us along they way. Building and the whole making of
    the weather balloon was awesome, i favorite part was watching the balloon get closer to the earths atomosphere.The first picture should take you to an article where you can read more about
    the weather balloon.</p>

             <h2><u>Python</u></h2>
             <p>Python is a <mark>widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.</mark> Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
             and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.</p>

       <h2><u>NetLogo</u></h2>
             <p>NetLogo <mark> is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment</mark>. It is used by tens of thousands of students, teachers and researchers worldwide.
             It also powers HubNet participatory simulations. It is authored by Uri Wilensky and developed at the CCL.</p>
